# My experience at Gndec

#Day 1
My first day at GNDEC started with all the EE qnd OTHER BRANCHES students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 68 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

I learned an essential lesson: “Seize the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”

Next, the ADGP Officer shared invaluable insights about karma and the delayed rewards of good deeds. He spoke from experience for about an hour without any preparation, which was impressive. One piece of advice that stood out was: “Don’t be easily impressed; there’s always more to learn.”

#Day 2
During our college induction program, we had the privilege of attending a thought-provoking session on Universal Human Values by Dr. Priya Darshini ma’am. She beautifully explained the importance of values like respect, honesty, compassion, and responsibility in shaping not only good professionals but also good human beings. Through real-life examples and interactive discussions, she encouraged us to reflect on our behavior, relationships, and purpose in life. Her words made us realize that education is not just about academics, but also about building character and contributing positively to society. The session truly inspired us to be more mindful, empathetic, and value-driven individuals.
